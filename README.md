# Display Image On Any Screen

What's the easiest way to display an image on a screen? This is. Just drag an image to the display you want it to appear. Supports multiple displays.

## How to use

1. Install on any PHP enabled server
2. Open index.html
3. Click Add Display and give it a name
4. Upload an image by dragging it on the display list (or on the opened display)
5. Double-click anywhere to go full screen

Fox maximum user experience, open index.html on another display. It syncs the image automagically.
